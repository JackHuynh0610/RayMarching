#What's raymarching

Ray marching is a class of rendering methods for 3D computer graphics where rays are traversed iteratively, effectively dividing each ray into smaller ray segments, sampling some function at each step. This function can encode volumetric data for volume ray casting, distance fields for accelerated intersection finding of surfaces, among other information.
