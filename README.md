# RayMarching
This program simulate a technique used in computer graphics, particularly in the context of rendering images, to generate realistic and complex scenes, especially in the field of real-time computer graphics and interactive applications. Unlike traditional rasterization techniques, which involve rendering triangles and pixels, raymarching is based on tracing rays through a scene and iteratively marching along those rays to find the intersection points with surfaces in a 3D environment.
