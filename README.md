# RayMarching
This program simulate a technique used in computer graphics, particularly in the context of rendering images, to generate realistic and complex scenes, especially in the field of real-time computer graphics and interactive applications. Unlike traditional rasterization techniques, which involve rendering triangles and pixels, raymarching is based on tracing rays through a scene and iteratively marching along those rays to find the intersection points with surfaces in a 3D environment.

- If you already have **JRE** installed, go to [Getting Started](#getting-started).

**See if you have JRE on your system**
- For _macOS and Linux_:
  - Open a terminal window. Type in

  - Look for **.jar** file to download. Remember where you installed, navigate to that folder, double click on it then Enjoy!.
- **Option 2**
  - Clone this repository, navigate to jar file and then just run it. By cloning you can see the source code and test stuff out on your own machine.
### TroubleShoot
- If you have **JRE** installed but the program still not run
